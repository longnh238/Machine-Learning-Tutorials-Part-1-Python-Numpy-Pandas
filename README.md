## Introduction

In this first part of the series, we focus on:
- Basics of **Python** for machine learning
- Introduction to **NumPy** for numerical computing
- Introduction to **Pandas** for data manipulation

The aim is to provide a strong foundation in these tools before moving on to more complex machine learning algorithms.
